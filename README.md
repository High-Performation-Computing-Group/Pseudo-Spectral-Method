# Pseudo-Spectral-Method
Pseudo-spectral methods also known as discrete variable representation (DVR) methods, are a class of numerical methods used in applied mathematics and scientific computing for the solution of partial differential equations. 
We are going to post tutorials to learn and implement the concepts of Pseudo-Spectral Method using Julia and Python programming language.
# Why Julia
Julia is a programming language developed for scientific computing at MIT. It combines the speed of C/Fortran with the interactiveness and High level programming of Python/Matlab, resolving the "2 language problem". Julia offers many features that make it suitable for science and make you fall in love with computational science.
