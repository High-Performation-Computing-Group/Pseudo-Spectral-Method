If you have no programming experience, I strongly encourage you to go through the first handful of modules on the [Codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) as soon as possible. During the semester, you may want to take more of the modules, and you should plan to spend extra time on this class.\n",

They are in the form of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). More information on notebooks in the next section. You should start each class by clicking on the appropriate materials in the [weekly schedule](https://github.com/kthyng/python4geosciences/blob/master/README.md).\n",

You'll need to sign in with your netid, and click on the little blue link that says \"AnyConnect VPN\" if and when you find that \"Web-based installation was unsuccessful\" to install Cisco AnyConnect (you will no longer use the web-based installer after this). When you open the Cisco application on your computer, you will need to fill in \"connect.tamu.edu\" in the little box, then use your netid and university password to connect. Then you can run this application to use your computer as if you are on campus.\n",

    "\n",
    "This file format makes it easy to seamlessly combine text and code. The text can be plain or formatted with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The code can be written in over 40 languages including Python, R, and Scala. Most importantly, the code can be interacted with when the notebook is opened in a local (that is, on your computer) iPython server. Alternatively, it can simply be viewed through a github repository (like [this very notebook](https://github.com/kthyng/python4geosciences/blob/master/materials/intro.ipynb)) or through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "You all have a username and password on a local machine that is running a server for us to use in class. By using this, we will be able to avoid a lot of installation issues that occur from using different operating systems, etc. You'll be able to run class materials (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) through this server via your web browser as well as create and work on homework assignments. If you prefer, you are welcome to run Python on your own computer, but you will need to do that mostly on your own. If you go that route, I recommend using Python 3 (which we will be using in class) and a distribution from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We'll talk about it as a class later in the semester, too. I recommend you all use this system I have set up for you. It will integrate nicely for our homeworks, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the server, open your web browser and navigate to `https://redfish.geos.tamu.edu:8000` and sign in with the username and password that I have emailed you. I've already set it up so that you can access materials and create notebooks within this system.\n",

    "* `pwd`: print working directory, as in write out the current location in the terminal window.\n",
    "* `ls`: list files in current directory. `ls -l` list files in long format to include more information, `ls -a` to list all files even those that are usually not shown because the have a `.` in front, `ls -h` to show file sizes in human readable format. Flags can always be combined to use multiple options at once, as in `ls -ah` to show all files in human readable format.\n",
    "* [tab]: Tab completion. You can always push tab in the terminal window to see available options. As you have some letters entered and push tab, the options will be limited to those that fit the pattern you have started.\n",
    "* `mkdir [dirname]`: make directory called dirname.\n",
    "* `rm [filename]`: remove a file called filename. To remove a directory called dirname, use `rm -r [dirname]`."
