    "*Loop syntax*: Loops have a very particular syntax in Python; this syntax is one of the most notable features to Python newcomers. The format looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "    for *element* in *sequence*:                # NOTE the colon at the end\n",
    "        <some code that uses the *element*>     # the block of code that is looped over for each element\n",
    "        <more code that uses the *element*>     # is indented four spaces (yes four! yes spaces!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <the code after the loop continues>         # the end of the loop is marked simply by unindented code\n",
    "    \n",
    "Thus, indentation is significant to the code. This was done because good coding practice (in almost all languages, C, FORTRAN, MATLAB) typically indents loops, functions, etc. Having indentation be significant saves the end of loop syntax for more compact code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some important notes on indentation*  Indentation in python is typically *4 spaces*. Most programming text editors will be smart about indentation, and will also convert TABs to four spaces. Jupyter notebooks are smart about indentation, and will do the right thing, i.e., autoindent a line below a line with a trailing colon, and convert TABs to spaces. If you are in another editor remember: ___TABS AND SPACES DO NOT MIX___. See [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for more information on the correct formatting of Python code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Classes are used to define generic objects. The 'instances' of the class are supplied with specific data. Classes define a data structure, 'methods' to work with this data, and 'attributes' that define the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The computer science way to think of classes\n",

    "In this case the object is a `car`, a generic kind of vehicle. We see in the sentence that we have a particular instance of a `car`, a *white* `car`. Obviously, there can be many instances of the class `car`. White is a defining or distinguishing 'attribute' of the car. There are two 'methods' noted: signaling and turning. We might write the code for a `car` object like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Car(object):\n",
    "        \n",

    "            <turning code>\n",
    " \n",
    "###### The scientific way to thing about classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, in science we use objects to store and work with complicated data sets, so it is natural to think of the data structure first, and use that to define the class. The methods are functions that work on this data. The attributes hold the data, and other defining characteristics about the dataset (i.e., metadata). The primary advantage of this approach is that the data are in a specified structure, so that the methods can assume this structure and are thereby more efficient.\n",

    "        '''\n",
    "        Documentation describing the object, in particular how it is instantiated.\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        def __init__(self, z, temp, lat, lon, time):\n",
    "            self.z = z            # A sequence of values defining the vertical positions of the samples\n",
    "            self.property = temp  # A corresponding sequence of temperature values\n",
    "            self.lat = lat        # The latitude at which the profile was taken\n",
    "            self.lon = lon        # The longitude at which the profile was taken\n",
    "            self.time = time      # The time at which the profile was taken\n",

    "\n",
    "Note, there could be a number of different choices for how the data are stored, more variables added to the profile, etc. Designing good classes is essential to the art of computer programming. Make classes as small and agile as possible, building up your code from small, flexible building blocks. Classes should be parsimonious and cogent. Avoid bloat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are traditionally named with a Capitol, sometimes CamelCase, sometimes underlined_words_in_a_row, as opposed to functions which are traditionally lower case (there are many exceptions to these rules, though). When a class instance is created, the special `__init__` function is called to create the class instance. Within the class, the attributes are stored in `self` with a dot and the attribute name. Methods are defined like normal functions, but within the block, and the first argument is always `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other special functions, that allow you to, for exmaple, overload the addition operator (`__add__`) or have a representation of the class that resembles the command used to create it (`__repr__`).\n",
